Two amodal instance segmentation(AIS) datasets in the field of remote sensing, a multi-view building dataset for the Zurich region (MVB-Zurich) and a multi-size building dataset for the Dortmund region (MSB-Dortmund are proposed. Recently, instance segmentation has become a common method for building extraction. However, when using such an algorithm to extract buildings, there is a disadvantage that the invisible area cannot be predicted. Therefore, the contour of the building extracted is incomplete, which is unfavorable for some applications based on building extraction. AIS is a new research field to overcome this defect. However, there is no dataset for the development of the AIS algorithm in the field of remote sensing, which hinders the application of AIS in the field of remote sensing. Two AIS datasets related to remote-sensing buildings were proposed. The images in the datasets were taken from tilt views through a tilt photography system, which makes the image contain a large number of occluded areas. Furthermore, the images in the MVB-Zurich dataset were obtained by aircraft from five views, and the MSB-Dortmund dataset contains varieties of buildings of different sizes, such as garages and residences. The multi-view and multi-size characteristics of the two datasets provided more research value. 
At present, some data of the MSB-Zurich dataset are uploaded. Soon, we will upload all the data and the corresponding annotation ground truth.
